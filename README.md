This is my attempt to create a list of algorithms for myself (and others) to learn them and to use as a reference.

##Algorithms implemented

###Graphs
- Shortest Paths
    - Dijkstra's algorithm
    - Bellman-Ford algorithm
    - Floyd-Warshall algorithm
    
- Maximum Flow
    - Ford-Fulkerson algorithm

###Mathematics
- Prime Sieves
    - Sieve of Eratosthenes
    - Sieve of Atkins

###Strings
- Searching
    - Naive string search
    - Rabin-Karp algorithm
